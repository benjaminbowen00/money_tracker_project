iSpend-iTrack

This is an app for tracking spending built using Ruby, Sinatra, Postgres, CSS and HTML. This was built as the first project on CodeClan's 16 week software development course.

The MVP was to be able to
1.  Record transactions
2.  Show a list of all transactions
3.  Show the total spending
4.  Show the total spending by category

In addition to this my app can:
1.  Allow users to see all transactions by category/shop
2.  Allow users to update, add and subtract from the budget
3.  Edit transactions, category and shops
4.  Add and delete categories and shops
5.  Show transactions just for the current month
6.  Show totals and transactions for the current month for a particular category or shop
7.  Show the monthly spend and transactions for each of the previous six months
